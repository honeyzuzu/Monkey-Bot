# Monkey-Bot
Discord Bot that responds to monkey-related words and is also.. quite wise sometimes. Created in Replit with Python and Discord API. 
Was created for a friend who loves monkeys. I also made it to get familiar with Discord API.

Commands:
$new <phrase>  will input the phrase desired in the bot's responses
$del <num>     will delete the phrase at that index and return the list of phrases
<monkey word>  will respond from a series of premade and user inputted phrases
"speak"        will randomly generate a phrase that ends in punctuation when "speak" is in any sentence
"strawberry"   will respond from a series of premade strawberry related responses 
"banana"       will respond from a series of premade banana related responses
"ice cream"    will respond from a series of premade ice cream related responses
